# Lane Lines

This is the first lane lines project for Udacity's Self-Driving car nanodegree program.  It is using relatively ad hoc methods to 
detect the lane lines on a road in moving video.  The general ideas in use are:

 * Color select
 * Canny filtering (with blur)
 * Hough transformation
 * Moving average filters

The stock and resulting videos are in the repo if you are interested.
